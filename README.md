# Sorting Visualizer

A web application that visualizes the inner workings of various sorting algorithms with interactive controls and step-by-step execution visualization. It helps users understand how different sorting algorithms operate by providing colored step representations and performance metrics.

## üöÄ Features

1. **Algorithm Visualizations**  
   - Visual representations of the following sorting algorithms:
     - Bubble Sort
     - Selection Sort
     - Insertion Sort
     - Merge Sort
     - Quick Sort
     - Heap Sort

2. **Color-Coded Visualization**  
   Each algorithm step is represented with different colors to enhance the learning experience:
   - **Blue**: Default (initial state)
   - **Yellow**: Elements being compared
   - **Red**: Elements identified to be in the incorrect position and ready to be swapped
   - **Green**: Elements in the correct position

3. **Interactive Controls**  
   Control the sorting visualization with the following options:
   - **Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of the visualization with 5 speed levels.
   - **Data Size**: Select the number of elements (data size) to be visualized.
   - **Generate New Data**: Randomly generate a new set of data for visualization.

4. **Performance Metrics**  
   Displays the **Time Complexity** and **Space Complexity** for the algorithm being visualized, helping users understand the algorithm‚Äôs efficiency.

## üìù Time and Space Complexity for Algorithms

Each sorting algorithm is accompanied by an analysis of its **time** and **space complexity** for different cases (Best, Average, Worst).

- **Bubble Sort**:  
  - Time Complexity: Best: \(O(n)\), Average: \(O(n^2)\), Worst: \(O(n^2)\)  
  - Space Complexity: \(O(1)\)

- **Selection Sort**:  
  - Time Complexity: Best, Average, and Worst: \(O(n^2)\)  
  - Space Complexity: \(O(1)\)

- **Insertion Sort**:  
  - Time Complexity: Best: \(O(n)\), Average: \(O(n^2)\), Worst: \(O(n^2)\)  
  - Space Complexity: \(O(1)\)

- **Merge Sort**:  
  - Time Complexity: Best, Average, and Worst: \(O(n \log n)\)  
  - Space Complexity: \(O(n)\)

- **Quick Sort**:  
  - Time Complexity: Best, Average: \(O(n \log n)\), Worst: \(O(n^2)\)  
  - Space Complexity: Average: \(O(\log n)\), Worst: \(O(n)\)

- **Heap Sort**:  
  - Time Complexity: Best, Average, and Worst: \(O(n \log n)\)  
  - Space Complexity: \(O(1)\)
